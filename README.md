## Why we built tiptap
We were looking for a text editor for [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and found some solutions that didnâ€™t really satisfy us. An editor should be easy to extend and not based on old dependencies such as jQuery. For React there is already a great editor called [Slate.js](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate), which impresses with its modularity. We came across [ProseMirror](https://github.com/prosemirror) and decided to build on it. ProseMirror is a toolkit for building rich text editors that are already in use at many well-known companies such as *Atlassian* or *New York Times*.

### What does `headless` mean?
With headless components you'll have (almost) full control over markup and styling. We donâ€™t want to tell you what a menu should look like or where it should be rendered in the DOM. Thatâ€™s all up to you. There is also a [great article about headless components](https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/) by Adam Wathan.

### How is the data stored under the hood?
You can save your data as a raw `HTML` string or can get a `JSON`-serializable representation of your document. And of course, you can also pass `HTML` or `JSON` content back to the editor.
