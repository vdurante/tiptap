After a few months of intense development of tiptap 2, Iâ€™m proud of what we achieved. Philipp, and the whole team, is really doing an amazing job. The all-new tiptap is so much better than version 1, but I donâ€™t want to talk too much here.

**From now on, [all sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ueberdosis) are invited to the all-new tiptap 2. New sponsors will receive a personal invite automatically.**

## Things we got already
* With TypeScript and all the tests, the whole code base feels pretty stable
* The new extension API is so much easier to understand
* Global attributes make extensions even more modular (text alignment! font family!)
* The collaborative editing experience is taken to a whole new level (weâ€™ll even provide a backend)
* Commands are chainable now ðŸ¤¯
* and *so* much more!

## Pls, share your feedback with us!
Have a look at the new documentation, the repository and start fiddling around with tiptap 2. Weâ€™re excited to hear what you think! Use GitHub issues, reach out on Twitter (https://twitter.com/hanspagel) or send a good old email to [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev)!

## Thank you!
All that would not have been possible without the support from the community, all those lovely sponsors funding our open-source work and the backing of Ã¼berdosis. Thank you all! And thanks for hitting the [Sponsor button on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/ueberdosis/) with so much love!

That said, we still have a lot on our roadmap: Publishing a dedicated collaboration backend, designing and building a new interface for tiptap 2, adding more and more extensions â€¦ Oh man, 2021 is going to be amazing.
