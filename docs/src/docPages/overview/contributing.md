# Contributing

Tiptap would be nothing without its lively community. Contributions have always been and will always be welcome. Here is a little bit you should know, before you send your contribution:

## Examples

* Improved documentation, e. g. fixing typos, new sections, further explanation …)
* New features for existing extensions, e. g. a new option
* New extensions, which don’t require changes to the core or other core extensions
* Well explained, non-breaking changes to the core

## Code style

There is a eslint config, that ensures a consistent code style. To check for errors, run `$ yarn run lint`. That’ll be checked when you send a pull request. Make sure it’s passing, before sending a pull request.

## Testing

All your pull requests will automatically run all our existing tests. Make sure that they all pass. Run all tests locally with `$ yarn run test` or run single tests (e. g. when writing new ones) with `$ yarn run test:open`.

Any further questions? Create a new issue or discussion in the repository. We’ll get back to you.
