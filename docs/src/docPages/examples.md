# Examples

We put together a few examples to show the capabilities of tiptap, but keep in mind: tiptap is renderless and highly customizable. Everything you see can be changed, modified, combined or remixed. Feel free to copy the code to your project and change it to your liking.

A few examples show what youâ€™d probably expect from a text editor anyway: [Basic](/examples/basic), [Links](/examples/links), [History](/examples/history), [Read-only](/examples/read-only), [Export HTML or JSON](/examples/export-html-or-json).

Some examples show how you can improve the user experience: [Markdown shortcuts](/examples/markdown-shortcuts).

Or they show advanced use cases, like the [Collaborative editing](/examples/collaborative-editing) example, which is basically tiptap in multiplayer mode.
