# Write a book

This demo has 150 paragraphs and more than 13,000 words, check the performance yourself. The most heavy processing is to check the active state of the buttons for the selection. If you’d like to optimize for that use case, try to limit those checks in your toolbar. But honestly, we think it’s great already, isn’t it?
