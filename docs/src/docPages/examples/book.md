# Long texts

This demo has 250 paragraphs and more than 22,000 words, check the performance yourself.

Most of the processing is needed to check the active state of the buttons for the selection. If you’d like to optimize for really long texts, try to limit these checks in your toolbar. But honestly, we think it’s great already, isn’t it?
