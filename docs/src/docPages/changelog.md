:::pro Help us fill this page!
A well-written changelog needs attention to detail, a great understanding of the project and time to write.

Though tiptap is used by thousands of developers all around the world, it’s still a side project for us. Let’s change that and make open source our full-time job! With nearly 300 sponsors we are half way there already.

Join them and become a sponsor! Enable us to put more time into open source and we’ll fill this page and keep it up to date for you.
