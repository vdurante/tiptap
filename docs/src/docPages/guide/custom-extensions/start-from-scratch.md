# Start from scratch

## 1. Read the documentation
Although tiptap tries to hide most of the complexity of ProseMirror, it’s built on top of its APIs and we recommend you to read through the [ProseMirror Guide](https://ProseMirror.net/docs/guide/) for advanced usage. You’ll have a better understanding of how everything works under the hood and get more familiar with many terms and jargon used by tiptap.

## 2. Have a look at existing extensions

## 3. Get started

## 4. Asking questions

## 5. Publishing a community extension
