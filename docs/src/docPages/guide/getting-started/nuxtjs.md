## Introduction
The following guide describes how to integrate tiptap with your Nuxt.js project.

## Requirements
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine
* Experience with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#Getting-Started)

## 1. Create a project (optional)
If you already have an existing Vue project, thatâ€™s fine too. Just skip this step and proceed with the next step.

For the sake of this guide, letâ€™s start with a fresh Nuxt.js project called `tiptap-example`. The following command sets up everything we need. It asks a lot of questions, but just use what floats your boat or use the defaults.

```bash
# create a project
npm init nuxt-app tiptap-example

# change directory
cd tiptap-example
```

## 3. Install the dependencies
Okay, enough of the boring boilerplate work. Letâ€™s finally install tiptap! For the following example youâ€™ll need `@tiptap/core` (the actual editor) and the `@tiptap/vue-starter-kit` which has everything to get started quickly, for example a few default extensions and a basic Vue component.

```bash
# install with npm
npm install @tiptap/core @tiptap/vue-starter-kit

# install with Yarn
yarn add @tiptap/core @tiptap/vue-starter-kit
```

If you followed step 1 and 2, you can now start your project with `npm run serve` or `yarn serve`, and open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your favorite browser. This might be different, if youâ€™re working with an existing project.

## 4. Create a new component
To actually start using tiptap, youâ€™ll need to add a new component to your app. Letâ€™s call it `Tiptap` and put the following example code in `src/components/Tiptap.vue`.

This is the fastest way to get tiptap up and running with Vue. It will give you a very basic version of tiptap, without any buttons. No worries, you will be able to add more functionality soon.

```html
<template>
  <editor-content :editor="editor" />
</template>

<script>
import { Editor, EditorContent, defaultExtensions } from '@tiptap/vue-starter-kit'

export default {
  components: {
    EditorContent,
  },

  data() {
    return {
      editor: null,
    }
  },

  mounted() {
    this.editor = new Editor({
      content: '<p>Iâ€™m running tiptap with Vue.js. ðŸŽ‰</p>',
      extensions: defaultExtensions(),
    })
  },

  beforeDestroy() {
    this.editor.destroy()
  },
}
</script>
```

## 5. Add it to your app
Now, letâ€™s replace the content of `src/App.vue` with the following example code to use our new `Tiptap` component in our app.

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <tiptap />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Tiptap from './components/Tiptap.vue'

export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    Tiptap
  }
}
</script>
```
::: warning Nuxt.js
If you use Nuxt.js, note that tiptap needs to run in the client, not on the server. Itâ€™s required to wrap the editor in a `<client-only>` tag.
:::

You should now see tiptap in your browser. Youâ€™ve successfully set up tiptap! Time to give yourself a pat on the back. Letâ€™s start to configure your editor in the next step.
