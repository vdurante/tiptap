# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
We value your privacy and question everything that stores or processes your personal information. With that in mind, we still need a few external services to publish tiptap.

Missing the cookie banner? Sorry, we don‚Äôt use cookies here. üç™

We don‚Äôt provide email support for tiptap, but if you have some legal issues, privacy or security concerns, send us an email to [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev). For everything else, [please use GitHub issues](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap-next/issues).

## List of external services

### GitHub
We use [GitHub](http://github.com/) to store our code, collaborate, give support, and offer sponsorships. Check their [privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) to learn more about what data they process.

### Netlify
We use Netlify to host the documentation. It features continuous deployment from Git across a global application delivery network and full integration with Let‚Äôs Encrypt. If you want to know more, [read Netlify‚Äôs privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

### Simple Analytics
We use [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/) to gain insight about our visitors in general. It doesn‚Äôt track individual users per se and does not store any personal identifiable information. Go to their documentation to find out what Simple Analytics collects (and more importantly what they don‚Äôt).

Or have a look at the [public analytics dashboard](https://simpleanalytics.com/tiptap.dev) they provide. It‚Äôs not a stripped down version, it‚Äôs the exact same dashboard we use to check the traffic.
