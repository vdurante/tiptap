## Introduction
We value your privacy and question everything that stores or processes your personal information. With that in mind, we still need a few external services to publish tiptap.

We don’t provide email support for tiptap, but if you have some legal issues, privacy or security concerns, send us an email to [hans.pagel@ueber.io](mailto:hans.pagel@ueber.io). For everything else, [please use GitHub issues](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap-next/issues).

## List of Services

### Netlify
We use Netlify to host our static website. It features continuous deployment from Git across a global application delivery network and full integration with Let’s Encrypt. [Read Netlify’s Privacy Policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/)

### Simple Analytics
To get critical information about the behavior of our visitors, we use [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/). This analytics software gives us insight about our visitors only in general, but not about individuals per se, as it does not track visitors and does not store any personal identifiable information. Go to their documentation to find out what Simple Analytics collects (and most importantly what they don't). Or have a look at our analytics dashboard: [https://simpleanalytics.com/tiptap.dev](https://simpleanalytics.com/tiptap.dev)
