# Become a sponsor
To deliver a top-notch developer experience and user experience, we put hundreds of hours of unpaid work into tiptap. Your funding helps us to make this work more and more financially sustainable. This enables us, to provide helpful support, maintain all our packages, keep everything up to date, and develop new features and extensions for tiptap.

If youâ€™re using tiptap in a commercial project or just want to give back to the open source community, you can [sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/ueberdosis).

## Your benefits as a sponsor
* Give back to the open source community
* Get early access to private repositories
* Your issues and pull requests get a `sponsor ðŸ’–` label
* Get a sponsor badge in all your comments on GitHub
* Show support in your GitHub profile
* Receive monthly reports about our open source work

Does that sound good? [Sponsor us on GitHub!](https://github.com/sponsors/ueberdosis)

## I canâ€™t use GitHub.
If youâ€™re a company, donâ€™t want to use GitHub, donâ€™t have a credit card or want a proper invoice form us, just reach out to us at [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev).

## I want consulting.
We donâ€™t do any calls, consulting or personal support. If you have an issue, a question, want to talk something through or anything else, [please use GitHub issues](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap-next/issues), to keep everything accessible for the whole community.

## Can we have a call?
Nope, we are big fans of asynchronous communication. If you really need to reach out in private, send us an email to [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev), but donâ€™t expect technical email support.
