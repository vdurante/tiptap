# Become a sponsor
To deliver you a top-notch developer experience and user experience, we put hundreds of hours of unpaid work into tiptap. Your funding helps us to make this work more and more financially sustainable. This enables us, to provide helpful support, maintain all our packages, keep everything up to date, and develop new features and extensions for tiptap.

If youâ€™re using tiptap in a commercial project or just want to give back to the open source community, you can [sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/ueberdosis).
