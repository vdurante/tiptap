# Introduction
tiptap is a <g-link to="/renderless">renderless</g-link> wrapper around [ProseMirror](https://ProseMirror.net) – a toolkit for building rich-text editors that are already in use at many well-known companies such as *New York Times*, *The Guardian* or *Atlassian*.

Although tiptap tries to hide most of the complexity of ProseMirror, it’s is built on top of its APIs and we strongly recommend you to read through the [ProseMirror Guide](https://ProseMirror.net/docs/guide/). You’ll have a better understanding of how everything works under the hood and get familiar with many terms and jargon used by tiptap.

## Renderless
The implementation of a text editor can be very specific for each use case. We don’t want to tell you what a menu should look like or where it should be rendered in the DOM. That’s why tiptap is renderless and comes without any CSS. You’ll have full control over markup and styling.
