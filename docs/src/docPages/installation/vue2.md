# Vue.js 2

## toc

## Introduction
The following guide describes how to integrate tiptap with your [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) CLI project.

## Requirements
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine
* [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) installed on your machine
* Experience with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#Getting-Started)

## 1. Create a project (optional)
If you already have an existing Vue project, thatâ€™s fine too. Just skip this step and proceed with the next step.

For the sake of this guide, letâ€™s start with a fresh Vue project called `tiptap-example`. The Vue CLI sets up everything we need, just select the default Vue 2 template.

```bash
# create a project
vue create tiptap-example

# change directory
cd tiptap-example
```

## 2. Install the dependencies
Okay, enough of the boring boilerplate work. Letâ€™s finally install tiptap! For the following example youâ€™ll need the `@tiptap/vue-2` package, with a few components, and `@tiptap/starter-kit` which has the most common extensions to get started quickly.

```bash
# install with npm
npm install @tiptap/vue-2 @tiptap/starter-kit

# install with Yarn
yarn add @tiptap/vue-2 @tiptap/starter-kit
```

If you followed step 1 and 2, you can now start your project with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`, and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your favorite browser. This might be different, if youâ€™re working with an existing project.

## 3. Create a new component
To actually start using tiptap, youâ€™ll need to add a new component to your app. Letâ€™s call it `Tiptap` and put the following example code in `components/Tiptap.vue`.

This is the fastest way to get tiptap up and running with Vue. It will give you a very basic version of tiptap, without any buttons. No worries, you will be able to add more functionality soon.

```html
<template>
  <editor-content :editor="editor" />
</template>

<script>
import { Editor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/vue-2'
import { defaultExtensions } from '@tiptap/starter-kit'

export default {
  components: {
    EditorContent,
  },

  data() {
    return {
      editor: null,
    }
  },

  mounted() {
    this.editor = new Editor({
      content: '<p>Iâ€™m running tiptap with Vue.js. ðŸŽ‰</p>',
      extensions: defaultExtensions(),
    })
  },

  beforeDestroy() {
    this.editor.destroy()
  },
}
</script>
```

## 4. Add it to your app
Now, letâ€™s replace the content of `src/App.vue` with the following example code to use our new `Tiptap` component in our app.

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <tiptap />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Tiptap from './components/Tiptap.vue'

export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    Tiptap
  }
}
</script>
```

You should now see tiptap in your browser. Youâ€™ve successfully set up tiptap! Time to give yourself a pat on the back.

## 5. Use v-model (optional)
Youâ€™re probably used to bind your data with `v-model` in forms, thatâ€™s also possible with tiptap. Here is a working example component, that you can integrate in your project:

<demo name="Guide/GettingStarted/VModel" />
