# CodeSandbox
CodeSandbox is an online coding environment. It’s great to fiddle around without setting up a local project. You can also use it to share your code and collaborate with others.

## Issue template
It’s also amazing for bug reports. Try to recreate a bug there and share it with us before you [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/issues/new/choose).

That helps us to reproduce the bug easily, and release a fix faster.
