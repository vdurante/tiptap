# Focus
The Focus extension adds a CSS class to focused nodes. By default it adds `.has-class`, but you can change that.

Note that itâ€™s only a class, the styling is totally up to you. The usage example below has some CSS for that class.

## Installation
```bash
# with npm
npm install @tiptap/extension-focus

# with Yarn
yarn add @tiptap/extension-focus
```
