# Gapcursor
This extension loads the [ProseMirror Gapcursor plugin](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror-gapcursor) by Marijn Haverbeke, which adds a gap for the cursor in places that donâ€™t allow regular selection. For example, after a table at the end of a document.

Note that tiptap is headless, but the dropcursor needs CSS for its appearance. The [default CSS](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap-next/tree/main/packages/core/src/style.ts) is loaded through the Editor class.
