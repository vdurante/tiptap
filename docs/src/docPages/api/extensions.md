# Extensions

> ⚠️ TODO: This is old content.

By default, the editor will only support paragraphs. Other nodes and marks are available as **extensions**. You must
install `tiptap-extensions` package separately so that you can use basic Nodes, Marks, or Plugins. An extension is
usually tied to a Command. The official set of commands are part of the
[`tiptap-commands`][@npmjs-tiptap-commands] package.
