# clearContent
The `clearContent` command deletes the current document.

Keep in mind that the editor will enforce the configured schema, and the document won’t be `null`. The default [`Document`](/api/nodes/document) expects to have at least one block node, which is the paragraph by default. In other words: Even after running that command the document will have at least one (empty) paragraph.

## Parameters
`emitUpdate: Boolean (false)`

By default, it doesn’t trigger the update event. Passing `true` doesn’t prevent triggering the update event.

## Usage
```js
// Remove all content from the document
editor.commands.clearContent()

// Remove all content, and trigger the `update` event
editor.commands.clearContent(true)
```
