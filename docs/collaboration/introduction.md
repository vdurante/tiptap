# Collaboration

Implementing real-time collaboration is quite hard. With Tiptap Collab we build a solution that does it in minutes. To see it in action check out our [live demo](https://tiptap.dev/editor).

Tiptap Collab is our managed cloud solution of [Hocuspocus](https://tiptap.dev/hocuspocus/introduction). It makes it a easy to add real-time collaboration to any application. If you already have an application using Tiptap Editor, it's even easier to add collaboration.
