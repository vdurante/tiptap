# Changelog
Tiptap consists of more than 50 separate packages, so it’s not that easy to keep that one big changelog. We got you covered though. Here is everything you need to follow the development during the beta phase:

1. You can find the [changelog for the core package](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/blob/main/packages/core/CHANGELOG.md) on GitHub here.
2. All packages have [a separate `CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/blob/main/packages), too.
3. During beta, it’s also helpful to keep an eye on the [merged Pull Requests on GitHub](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).
4. And we keep track of [what we want do do before a stable release](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/issues/2087) in a public issue.

Once we’re transitioning to a stable version, [we’ll write blog posts](/blog) about bigger changes and keep them in a changelog here.
