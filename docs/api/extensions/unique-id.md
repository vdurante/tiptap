# UniqueId
:::pro Pro extension
The UniqueId extension will be the first tiptap pro extension we’ll release on top of all the free extensions. Access to the extension and the documentation will require a tiptap pro subscription.
:::

The `UniqueId` extension adds unique IDs to all nodes. The extension keeps track of your nodes, even if you split them, merge them, undo/redo changes, crop content, paste content … It just works.

Also, you can configure which node types get an unique ID, and which not, and you can customize how those IDs are generated.

We’re preparing everything to release that extension, give us a few more days. If you can’t wait to purchase a tiptap pro license and get access to the extensions, send us an email to [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev).
